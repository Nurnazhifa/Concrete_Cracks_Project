## General Information
- There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isnâ€™t compacted properly as well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not being 
identified quickly and left untreated. Hence, image classification is used to classify concretes with or without cracks. The developed model might impactful and may save thousands of lives. 


## Technologies Used
Project is created with 
- Google colab
- Tensorboard (for visualization)

## Project Status

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Use MobileNetV3 as transfer learning method in the model architecture instead of using MobileNetV2
